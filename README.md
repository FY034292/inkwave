## Features

- **Turf war, 4 v 4.** Three minutes, most ground painted wins. Play against bots on three difficulty levels.
- **Friend match.** Create a room, send the 5-letter code (or the invite link), and play with up to five friends. Pick your team in the lobby; CPUs fill the empty slots. See [Friend match server](#friend-match-server).
- **Squid form.** Hold to dive into your ink: swim fast, refill your tank, climb inked walls, dolphin-jump water gaps.
- **Seven weapons**, each with its own feel: Spritzer (shooter), Swell Roller, Glint Charger, Popper Blaster, Twinfin Dualies (dodge roll), Tidebucket Slosher and Gyre Splatling. Every kit comes with Splat Bombs and a special.
- **Three stages, day or dusk.** Tidewater Plaza, Kelpline Terminal and Halyard Marina, a working marina with a car ferry moored across the middle where the water gaps are the whole point.
- **Ink that behaves like liquid.** Splats spread and settle, fresh ink is glossy and dries, drips run down walls, and swimming leaves a wake in the surface itself.
- **A map you can actually read.** Hold <kbd>Tab</kbd> and the camera cranes up into a tilt-shift diorama of the live stage, with pins for your team and one-click Super Jumps.
- **Locker.** Choose your squidkid: tentacle style, headgear, face, outfit.
- **Everything procedural.** Characters, animation, weapons, textures, props, sound effects and music are all generated in code. There are no downloaded assets except two fonts.

## Controls

| Action | Keyboard / mouse | Gamepad |
|---|---|---|
| Move | <kbd>W</kbd> <kbd>A</kbd> <kbd>S</kbd> <kbd>D</kbd> | Left stick |
| Aim | Mouse | Right stick |
| Fire | Left click | RT |
| Squid form | <kbd>Shift</kbd> | LT |
| Jump / dodge roll | <kbd>Space</kbd> | A |
| Sub weapon (bomb) | Right click / <kbd>E</kbd> | RB |
| Special | <kbd>F</kbd> | Y |
| Map + Super Jump | Hold <kbd>Tab</kbd> or <kbd>M</kbd>, then <kbd>1</kbd>–<kbd>4</kbd> or click a pin | View |
| Pause | <kbd>Esc</kbd> | Start |

Gamepads work on the hosted (https) version. On a plain `http://` LAN address browsers block the Gamepad API.

## Running locally

There is no build step. Any static file server works; the included one also serves to your LAN and sends no-cache headers so module updates are never stale.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jaydendavisnc/inkwave.git
cd inkwave
npm start        # http://localhost:8490
```

Useful URL parameters: `?map=halyard&time=dusk` picks a stage, `&autostart=180` skips the menus into a 180 s match, `&autopilot` lets a bot drive you.

```bash
npm install      # once, for the headless tools
npm run check    # syntax-check every module
npm run smoke    # boot + 8 s of autopilot in headless Chrome, fails on console errors
npm run build    # assemble dist/ (game + only the three.js addons it imports)
```

## Friend match server

Friend matches go through a tiny relay: a Cloudflare Worker with one Durable Object per room ([`server/`](server/src/index.js)). It only keeps the lobby and forwards match traffic; the game itself still runs in each browser.

```bash
npm run server           # local relay on :8787 (the game on localhost / your LAN finds it automatically)
npm run release:server   # deploy to your Cloudflare account (needs a one-time `npx wrangler login`)
```

After deploying, put the printed URL in `src/config.js` → `NET.server` (for example `https://inkwave-rooms.<you>.workers.dev`) and release the game. `?server=<url>` overrides it for testing. SQLite-backed Durable Objects run on the Workers free plan.

How a match stays in step: every player simulates their own squidkid and sends its state 20 times a second along with what it did (rounds fired, every splat painted, animation one-shots, splats and respawns). Other machines draw it about 110 ms in the past and replay its events on that timeline, so shots leave the gun when the gun is seen there and their paint lands with them. Hits are decided by the shooter and applied by the victim's owner. The host also runs the CPUs, the clock and the final judge. If a player leaves, the host's CPU takes over their squidkid. If the host leaves, the round ends and the next player becomes host. See [`src/net/sync.js`](src/net/sync.js).

## How it works

- **Ink is painted in texture space.** Every paintable face owns a region of one 4K atlas; splats are drawn into it on the GPU while a coarse CPU grid keeps the turf score and gameplay queries in sync. The level shader layers the ink over the surface with its own height, gloss and wetness. See [`src/world/paint.js`](src/world/paint.js) and [`src/world/inkShading.js`](src/world/inkShading.js).
- **Stages are data.** A layout is a list of boxes and ramps for one half of the arena; the other half is the 180° rotation, so both teams always get an identical field. Ambient occlusion is baked offline (`tools/bake-ao.mjs`). See [`src/world/maps.js`](src/world/maps.js).
- **Characters are fully procedural.** Geometry, materials, a 60-bone rig and every animation (locomotion, squid form, weapon poses, secondary motion) are code, driven by a spring-based pose system. See [`docs/RIG.md`](docs/RIG.md).
- **Systems talk through events.** Weapons, actors and the match emit typed events; effects, HUD and audio subscribe. The contract is documented in [`docs/EVENTS.md`](docs/EVENTS.md) and [`docs/CONTRACTS.md`](docs/CONTRACTS.md).
- **Deterministic tooling.** The game exposes a freeze/step debug interface so filmstrips, handling measurements and bot simulations are reproducible frame by frame (`tools/film.py`, `tools/measure-handling.mjs`).

Rendering is three.js r186 (vendored, plain ES modules with an import map) with GTAO, bloom and a custom grade pass.

## Browser support

Chrome and Edge are the target; Firefox works. Safari runs but is slower. A discrete or recent integrated GPU is recommended for the High preset; the settings menu has Medium and Low tiers.
